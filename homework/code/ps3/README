You can build our provided test harness by using make and then running

    ./test-overlap
    
from the command line. This program will generate large numbers of random
intervals, insert and remove them from your data structure, and check your data
structure against a (very slow) reference implementation that recomputes
overlap from scratch at each point in time.

Our Makefile will, by default, build all .cpp files in this directory and link
them into the test-overlap executable. Please only add .cpp files here if you
actually want to build them.

The test driver does not actually use the Treap type. You are free to do
whatever you'd like with that type, though we recommend using it as a validated
implementation of a balanced BST you can then build on for dynamic overlap.
